The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The `#myElement` selector is more specific than `.myClass`, so the background color should be set to red. However, due to an unexpected order of selector application, the background may still appear blue.

```css
#myElement {
  background-color: red;
}

.myClass {
  background-color: blue;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  background-color: green; /*This should not be applied due to specificity*/
}
```
